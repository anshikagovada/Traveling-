# Whitney High School 
### A view into Whitney High School

## Typical Schedule

### 1. We wake up bright and early to get to school on time. 
Most of us have 1st period which starts at 7 am. In order to be there on time and ready, you will need to be up by at least 6 am.

### 2. Atfer we get to school, we go to all of our classes.
I typically Whitney Student has about 7 classes.

For example, 

##### -1st period: AP Computer Science Prinicples

##### -2nd period-English

##### -3rd period-Math

##### -4th period-Language Class

##### -5th period-Chemistry

##### -6th period-History

##### -7th period-Sports or P.E.

Whitney is more of an acadmeic school than a sport school, however the sports we do play we play hard and mostly importantly always have fun.

### 3. After school
After school, we gp home and complete/start any work that we have to do.
